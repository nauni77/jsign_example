# jsign_example

This project contains an example of SpringBoot3 project with jSign.
It was created to reproduce the failure from issue [https://github.com/ebourg/jsign/issues/249](https://github.com/ebourg/jsign/issues/249).

Signings with YUBIKEY can be tested, this works.
But the same test structure using ETOKEN will cause failing tests.
